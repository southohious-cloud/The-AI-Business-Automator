# 🧠 GregoryArmstonPracticeFiles

This repository contains my CS50P practice files — a curated collection of Python exercises, variations, and refactors that reflect my learning journey and workflow‑architect mindset.

Each script explores a specific concept, often with multiple versions to show iteration, experimentation, and refinement. This repo is intentionally structured, modular, and aligned with my broader portfolio rhythm.

## 📁 Structure

Files are grouped by topic or problem set.  
Variations (e.g., `indoor2.py`) represent alternate approaches, refactors, or improved logic.

Example structure:

indoor/  
├── indoor.py — Original solution  
├── indoor2.py — Variation or refactor  

playback/  
├── playback.py  
├── playback2.py  

As more files are added, this structure will expand into a clean, navigable index.
