# 🧩Gregory Armston Practice Files

A minimal workspace for my CS50P practice variations.  
This repository contains alternate versions of exercises where CS50P encourages multiple approaches, or where I explore different solutions for deeper understanding.  
These files are not portfolio pieces and not official submissions — they exist solely as a record of my learning process, experiments, and occasional refactors.

## Current Files — Live Index

## Structure Philosophy

This workspace stays intentionally small and variation‑focused:

```
exercise-name/
    version.py
    version_final.py
```

Only exercises with meaningful variations appear here.  
All primary solutions remain in my main CS50P repository.
