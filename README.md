🌿 **Gregory Armston Practice Files**

A minimal workspace for my CS50P practice variations. This repository contains alternate versions of exercises where CS50P encourages multiple approaches, or where I explore different solutions for deeper understanding. These files are not portfolio pieces and not official submissions — they exist solely as a record of my learning process, experiments, and occasional refactors.
